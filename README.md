A conky (with a script written in Python) that shows the SPORTS events, using [Weatherapi API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) website.<br>

## **WIKI**<br>

Download the .zip file, extract the file, copy the file `.conkyrc_wasports` and the folder `.conky` inside your Linux `home`.<br>
If your `home` is named *pippo*, copy inside *pippo* so you get: `/home/pippo/.conky` and `/home/pippo/.conkyrc_wasports`<br>
Go to `/home/YOURHOMENAME/.conky/weather/Weatherapi/sports/` and open with a text editor the file `wasports.py`, go to row 18 and 19 and type your latitude and your longitude, go to row 20 and type your city name, go to row 21 and write your APPID.<br>
If you don't know how to get your APPID, follow this video instructions: [APPID guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgRy3O12DKo&list=PLTjXqPpTV2L84EMOTS0EKjUvGxnNDtVM3&index=23)<br>
In the `font` folder, you can find some fonts you need.<br>
The python script saves data in file so you can build your conky weather as you wish.<br>
The `.conkyrc_wasports` file i attach, works.<br>
Run the file `.conkyrc_wasports` from terminal (the first time you run this conky), so you can get possible errors.

I don't know if this service works for every city in the world, just try for yours.<br>
I guess it works better for Anglo-Saxon countries.
